                <h3><strong>VAR:</strong></h3>
                <strong>Function Scope : </strong>
                <br>
                Variables declared with var are function-scoped. They are only
                accessible within the function where they are defined.
                <br>
                <strong>Hoisting :</strong>
                <br>
                Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their
                containing function or global scope, meaning you can use them
                before they are declared, but they will be initialized with
                undefined until their actual declaration.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3><strong>LET:</strong></h3>
                <strong>Block Scope :  </strong>
                <br>
                Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are
                accessible only within the block where they are defined. A block
                can be a function, loop, or any code enclosed in curly braces {}.
                <br>
                <strong>Hoisting : </strong>
                <br>
                Variables declared with let are also hoisted to the top of their
                containing block, but they are not initialized, so you can't use
                them before their declaration.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3><strong>CONST :</strong></h3>
                <strong>Block Scope :  </strong>
                <br>
                Like let, const is also block-scoped.
                <br>
                <strong>Immutability : </strong>
                <br>
                Variables declared with const are meant to be constants, and their
                value cannot be reassigned after initialization. However, for
                objects and arrays declared with const, you can still modify their
                properties or elements; you just can't reassign the variable
                itself.

                <h3><strong>NULL :</strong></h3>
                <strong>Explicit Absence of Value : </strong>
                <br>
                null is a value that represents the intentional absence of any
                object value or value in general. It is typically used when you
                want to indicate that a variable or property should have no value
                or that it has been intentionally cleared.
                <br>
                <strong>>As a Placeholder : </strong>
                <br>
                It can also be used as a placeholder or initial value that might
                be assigned a value later in your code.
                <br>
                <strong>>Returned by Functions : </strong>
                <br>
                Some functions or methods may return null to indicate that they
                did not find a meaningful result.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3><strong>undefined :</strong></h3>
                <strong>Default Value : </strong>
                <br>
                In JavaScript, variables that have been declared but have not been
              assigned a value are automatically initialized with undefined. So,
              undefined is often used as the default value for function
              parameters and variables.
                <br>
                <strong>>Property Access : </strong>
                <br>
                If you try to access an object property that does not exist, you
              will get undefined.
                <br>
                <strong>>Array Elements : </strong>
                <br>
                When you access an array element that is beyond the current length
                of the array, you get undefined.
                <br>
                <strong>Function Return  : </strong>
                <br>
                If a function does not explicitly return a value, it returns
              undefined.
            </div>
          </div>

                What do you mean by REST API?

          <div id="collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingThree" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">

                <h3><strong>REST API  :</strong></h3>
                <br>
                REST API   is an
            application programming interface that adheres to the constraints of
            REST architectural style and enables interaction with RESTful web
            services. Interconnected networks make up the web. A web service is
            a set of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data
            between client-server applications. Web services that follow the
            REST architecture are known as RESTful web services.
